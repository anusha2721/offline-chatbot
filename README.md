# offline-chatbot
I developed an offline chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs entirely in the browser without internet or server support. It uses a predefined knowledge base with rule-based logic for instant responses, features a clean user-friendly interface, and is ideal for use in low-connectivity environments.
